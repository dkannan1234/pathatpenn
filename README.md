CIS 4120 Assignment 1: Prototype of Path at Penn redesign 

This is a remodel of the Path @ Penn design. There is nothing special about running it: there is the advancedSearch button that is accessible from the home page of index.html, that just shows the features to select specific times and course attributes. 

I utilized OpenAI for styles.css to help with the margins and padding especially, and being able to do better design. Prior to this, I was only able to make simple boxes, but I wanted to be able to make nicer panels and buttons.
